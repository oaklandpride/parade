        <h3 id="pcv" class="fw-bold">Parade Contingent Volunteers</h3>
        <p class="lead">For the efficient and safe execution of the Parade, <span class="fw-bold">each contingent is
                required to appoint one contingent monitor for every 25 people in the contingent, and two wheel monitors
                for every basic vehicle in the contingent. </span>For large trucks, floats, buses, and other vehicles
            over 10 feet, increase the number of wheel monitors to four (4).</p>
        <p>This means that a contingent of 100 people and one vehicle would need four contingent monitors and two wheel
            monitors. A contingent of 50 people and two vehicles would need two contingent monitors and four wheel
            monitors.</p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Contingent monitors</b> are responsible for ensuring that the contingent stays in formation and
                follows the Parade route. They also help to keep the contingent safe by monitoring the crowd and making
                sure that everyone is staying a safe distance from the vehicles.</li>
            <li><b>Wheel monitors</b> are responsible for ensuring that marchers do not become caught in the wheels of a
                vehicle. They stand along either side of a vehicle, and must be in place at all times a vehicle is in
                motion. They should stand an arm's-length away on each side of a basic vehicle, or an arm's length away
                parallel to the axles. Drivers may not move their vehicles unless wheel monitors are in place.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The contingent monitors help to keep the Parade moving smoothly, and the wheel monitors help to prevent
            accidents. This ensures that everyone involved in the Parade can enjoy it safely and without incident.</p>
        <p>Here are some additional things to keep in mind when appointing contingent monitors and wheel monitors:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Contingent monitors should be people who are familiar with the Parade route and the location of all
                vehicles.</li>
            <li>Wheel monitors should be people who are familiar with the operation of vehicles and capable of keeping
                people away from the wheels.</li>
            <li>Both contingent monitors and wheel monitors should be able to communicate effectively with the drivers
                of vehicles and the participants in the Parade.</li>
            <li>Both contingent monitors and wheel monitors should be able to remain calm and focused under pressure.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>By following these guidelines, you can help to ensure that the contingents in your Parade are well-organized
            and safe.</p>

        <h3>Radio Etiquette</h3>
        <p>If you have been equipped with a two-way radio, use these guidelines for effective communication.</p>
        <p>Speak clearly and slowly when using your radio.</p>
        <p>Be aware of the noise level around you. If there is a lot of noise, you may need to speak closer to the
            microphone or turn away from the sound.</p>
