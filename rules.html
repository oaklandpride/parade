        <h2>General Parade Information</h2>
        <p>The Parade will begin at 11am, starting from 14th on Broadway, turning left onto Broadway and proceeding
            until 20th.</p>
        <p>The parade start time has been pushed back an hour to 11am to better align with the gates of the celebration opening.</p>
        <p>Contingents have been asked to assemble in the order they will march in the Parade, beginning as early as
            9:00 AM for Dykes on Bikes, 10:15 AM starting time for contingents on Assembly blocks A, B, and C, with the
            final contingents in place close to the starting time (11:00 AM), on Assembly blocks D and E.</p>
            <p>We ask contingents to arrive precisely within the window of time provided for assembly and to proceed directly to their assembly zone once they have entered the parade assembly area.</p>

        <h2>Line Up for the Parade</h2>
        <p>Contingents have each been given an <u>order number</u>, an <u>assembly zone</u>, and a <u>load-in time</u>. We ask that
            contingents are <strong>fully assembled and ready to move at their load-in time</strong>.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Zones A and B enter on 14th Street at Jefferson Street</li>
                <li>Zones C and D enter on Clay Street at 16th Street</li>

        <h2>The Flow of the Parade</h2>
        <p>It is very important that once the Parade begins contingents maintain continuous forward momentum until the end of the route as they
            enter the dispersal area. Congestion and delays can be detrimental to participants who are not able to stand
            around waiting due to health concerns, or upcoming hot dates.</p>
        <p>Volunteers along the route may indicate to your contingent the need to <b>speed up</b> to close a gap, or
            they may instruct to <b>slow down</b>. These commands will be indicated by the volunteer using one or both
            hands with a finger to repeatedly point up or down before them.</p>

        <h2>Parade Dispersal</h2>

        <p>Contingents reach the end of the Parade at 20th, and must either turn right to enter the festival, or
            continue
            forward to turn left on 21st and exit the Parade and festival area.</p>

        <p>Contingents should review this list of prohibited items that will not be allowed into the festival area:</p>
        Any bag or container over 12” x 12”
        <ul>
            <li>Outside drinks or food</li>
            <li>Alcohol</li>
            <li>Coolers</li>
            <li>Glass containers/ bottles</li>
            <li>Illegal drugs or substances</li>
            <li>Hazardous or toxic materials</li>
            <li>Firearms, fireworks, explosives nor flammable liquids</li>
            <li>Drones</li>
            <li>Weapons of any kind</li>
            <li>Pepper spray, mace, aerosol spray, tear gas</li>
            <li>Knives, impact or electric pulse weapons</li>
            <li>Stunning devices</li>
            <li>Radios, walkie-talkies, jammers, scanners</li>
            <li>Portable speakers</li>
            <li>Lawn chairs</li>
            <li>Any item deemed inappropriate or hazardous by law enforcement and/or security</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="fw-bold">There will be security screening and metal detectors at all points of
            entry. Bags are highly discouraged, and no bags over 12” x 12” will be admitted.</p>

        <p><b>Dispersal volunteers</b> will stand on Broadway Street around 20th Street. Volunteers will direct
            the flow of traffic using the following guidelines:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>contingents leaving the site proceed down Broadway and turn left on 21st.</li>
            <li>marchers entering the festival turn right on 20th.</li>
            <li>vehicles letting people off stop on the right side of Broadway in between 20th and 21st, and then
                exit to the left on 21st</li>
        </ol>

        <p>There are very few exceptions, use your best judgement, escalate issues on the radio.</p>

        <p>The Parade contingents have been provided the following instructions for when they reach the end of the
            route:</p>

        <h3>If your contingent is going to the festival</h3>
        <p>As you reach the end of the Parade you will come to the dispersal area in between 20th and 21st. Marchers
            stay to the
            right to exit the Parade route and enter the main entrance on 20th.</p>
        <p>Vehicles letting passengers off will be directed to move to the right and stop in the designated area.
            Once passengers have disembarked vehicles will proceed, turning left on 21st and leaving the Parade and
            festival area.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h3>If your contingent is not going to the festival</h3>
        <p>As you reach the end of the Parade you will come to the dispersal area in between 20th and 21st, stay to
            the
            left,
            eventually turning left on 21st and leaving the Parade and festival area.</p>
